# Python Programming Examples

This repository contains a collection of Python examples demonstrating fundamental programming concepts. These examples are designed to help beginners learn Python programming through practical implementations.

## Files Overview

### 1. `bigstring.py`
Demonstrates different ways to print multi-line strings in Python:
- Using separate print statements with `\n` for line breaks
- Using triple quotes (`"""`) for multi-line string literals

### 2. `dictionary1.py`
Shows how to work with dictionaries in Python:
- Creating dictionaries with predefined keys and values
- Accessing dictionary values using keys
- Dynamic dictionary creation from user input
- Converting comma-separated strings into lists and using them to populate dictionaries

### 3. `for1.py`
Demonstrates how to iterate through lists using for loops:
- Defines multiple lists
- Accesses list elements by index using a range-based for loop

### 4. `for2.py`
Shows different ways to iterate over a list of dictionaries:
- While loop with counter
- For loop with range
- For loop with element access by index
- For loop with direct element iteration (unpacking)

### 5. `functions1.py`
Explains function definition and usage in Python:
- Creating reusable functions
- Function parameters and return values
- Importance of return statements in functions
- Taking user input and applying functions

## Running the Examples

Each Python file can be run independently using:

```bash
python filename.py
```

For example:
```bash
python functions1.py
```

Some scripts require user input, so be prepared to enter values when prompted.

## Learning Progression

For those new to Python, it's recommended to study these examples in the following order:

1. `bigstring.py` - Learn about printing and string formatting
2. `for1.py` - Understand basic list handling and iteration
3. `for2.py` - Explore advanced iteration techniques
4. `dictionary1.py` - Learn about key-value data structures
5. `functions1.py` - Understand how to create reusable code blocks

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
